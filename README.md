For the assignment a program that would translate AH! Code to ASCII and vice versa had to be built using
Arduino Uno microcontroller board and Arduino shield containing LEDs, potentiometer, button, earphone jack 
and IR LED and sensor. 
The system must be able to transmit the AH! Code by LED using blue LED if the 
input was AH! Code and green LED if the input was ASCII. Finally, the system must be able to respond
to 4 commands: S+ (transfer AH! Code through sound), S- (sound off), POT (show the value of potentiometer),
L followed by 12 decimal digits (changes the brightness of LEDs)
